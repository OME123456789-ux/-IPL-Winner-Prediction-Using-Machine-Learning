# 🏆 IPL Winner Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the winner of IPL matches using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical match data and considers various factors such as venue, teams, win ratios, and match statistics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning-Based Prediction**: Predict match winners based on statistical data.
- **Interactive GUI**: Users can select match details and get instant predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays correlation matrices and insights from the dataset.

## 🛠 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPL-Winner-Prediction.git
cd IPL-Winner-Prediction
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Then, install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Run

### Step 1: Open a terminal in the project folder

### Step 2: Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook IIDT_IPL_WINNER_PREDICTION_USING_ML.ipynb
```

### Step 3: Interact with the GUI
- Select the **date, venue, teams, and umpires**.
- Enter **win ratios and other parameters**.
- Click **Predict** to get match winner probabilities.

## 🌐 Dataset
The dataset consists of IPL match records stored in `matches.csv`. It includes:
- Match details (venue, teams, umpires)
- Team performance metrics
- Toss decisions and other influencing factors
